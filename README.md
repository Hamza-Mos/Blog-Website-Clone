# Blog-Website-Clone
This website simulates a traditional blog website. Each message is rendered from my MongoDB cluster. 
When you compose a message and hit "Publish," a POST request is sent to my MongoDB Database to store the message.
Here is a link to the deployed app: https://warm-dusk-91014.herokuapp.com/
